## Nuances of unwrap method on Result:


1. **Understanding `Result` Enum**:
   - `Result` has two variants: `Ok(T)` and `Err(E)`, where `T` and `E` are generic types. 
   - The `unwrap` method tries to extract the value from the `Ok` variant. If it's in the `Err` variant, it panics.

2. **The Role of the `Copy` Trait**:
   - Rust can either **copy** or **move** the data when extracting it from the enum variant, depending on whether the data implements the `Copy` trait.
   - If the type implements `Copy` (like a primitive type or a `&str`), Rust will make a **copy** of the data.
   - If it doesn't implement `Copy` (like `String`), **ownership is moved** to the variable that takes the data.

3. **Ownership Transfer Example**:
   - If you match on a `Result` enum, and you extract data from the `Ok` variant, it moves ownership. 
   - After a move, you can no longer access the original value. This can lead to a compile-time error if you try to use `unwrap` again on the moved value.

4. **How `unwrap` Behaves**:
   - If you use `unwrap` on a moved value (like `String`), you'll get a "value partially moved here" error because Rust knows ownership was transferred.
   - You can fix this by borrowing the data (using references), which avoids moving ownership.

5. **Using `&str` (String Slices)**:
   - If the data inside the `Result` is a `&str` (string slice), it implements `Copy`. This means you can copy the reference without moving the actual data, and `unwrap` will work without errors.
   - String slices are cheap to copy because they are just references to immutable data.

6. **Example with `&str`**:
   - By using `&str` in both the `Ok` and `Err` variants, you avoid ownership moves. Both the `Ok` and `Err` variants contain a reference, and the `unwrap` method works multiple times since Rust knows it's not transferring ownership.

7. **Key Takeaway**:
   - Whether `unwrap` works or not depends on whether the data implements `Copy`. If the data does not implement `Copy`, Rust moves the data, and subsequent use of `unwrap` will fail due to ownership being transferred.
   - If the data implements `Copy`, like `&str`, the data is just copied, so `unwrap` can be safely used multiple times without problems.
