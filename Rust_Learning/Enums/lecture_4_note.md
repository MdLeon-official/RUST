# Enum Memory Allocation in Rust

## How Rust Handles Memory for Enums
- Enums can have multiple variants with different types and sizes of associated data.
- Rust ensures efficient memory allocation by:
  - Choosing a memory size based on the **largest variant**.

### Example: Memory Requirements for Variants
1. **Pointer to a String**:
   - On the stack, a pointer to a `String` occupies **24 bytes**.
   - The actual string data resides on the heap.
2. **CreditCard and DebitCard Variants**:
   - Each stores one `String` → Requires **24 bytes**.
3. **PayPal Variant**:
   - Stores two `String`s → Requires **48 bytes** (24 × 2).

### Memory Allocation
- Rust allocates memory for the largest variant:
  - In this example, the `PaymentMethodType` enum requires **48 bytes**.
  - This ensures smooth reassignment between variants without reallocating memory.
  
### Additional Details
- Memory includes space for:
  - Associated data.
  - Metadata to identify the current variant (e.g., `CreditCard` or `PayPal`).
- The total size of the enum may exceed the sum of its associated values due to metadata and optimizations.

### Why It Matters
- Rust supports the **"worst-case scenario"** by pre-allocating sufficient memory for any variant.
- This eliminates runtime memory reallocation, ensuring efficient performance.

## Key Takeaways
- Memory allocation is based on the **largest variant**.
- Rust handles memory management efficiently, so you rarely need to optimize it manually.
- Understanding these concepts helps in reasoning about how Rust ensures program safety and efficiency.
