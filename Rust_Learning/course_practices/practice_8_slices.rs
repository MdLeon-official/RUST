    /*
    Define a `cereals` array with 5 heap Strings
      - Cookie Crisp
      - Cinnamon Toast Crunch
      - Frosted Flakes
      - Cocoa Puffs
      - Captain Crunch
     
    Declare a `first_two` variable that extracts a slice
    of the first two cereals. Print the slice.
     
    Declare a `mid_three` variable that extracts a slice
    of the middle three cereals (Cinnamon Toast Crunch
    up to and including Cocoa Puffs). Print the slice.
     
    Declare a `last_three` variable that extracts a slice
    of the last three cereals. Print the slice.
     
    Using the `last_three` slice, target the last element
    ("Captain Crunch") and replace it with "Lucky Charms".
    Print the complete `cereals` array.
     
    Declare a `cookie_crisp` variable that references the
    "Cookie Crisp" String.
     
    Declare a `cookie` variable that extracts a slice of
    the text "Cookie" from the String. Print the slice.
     
    Declare a `cocoa_puffs` variable. Make it a reference
    to the "Cocoa Puffs" String (in other words, a &String).
     
    Declare a `puffs` variable that extracts a slice of
    the text "Puffs" from the String. Print the slice.
