# The self Keyword:

## 1. Importing a Module with `use`  
In Rust, we can use the `use` keyword to bring a module into scope. Since a module is just another name in our program, we can simplify access by bringing it directly to the top level.  

### Example:  
Instead of writing:  
```rust
use inventory::products::ProductCategory;
use inventory::products::Item;
```
We can simplify it by making the `products` submodule available:  
```rust
use inventory::products;
```
Now, we can reference:  
```rust
products::ProductCategory;
products::Item;
```
This avoids repeating `inventory::` every time.

## 2. Importing Both a Module and an Item in One Line  
Rust allows us to bring in both a module and specific names inside it in a single line.  

### Before (Two Lines):  
```rust
use inventory::products;
use inventory::products::ProductCategory;
```
### After (Using `{}` and `self`):  
```rust
use inventory::products::{self, ProductCategory};
```
Here, `self` refers to the module (`products`), keeping it accessible while also directly importing `ProductCategory`.  

---

## 3. Why Use `self`?  
The `self` keyword helps:  
✅ Keep the module (`products`) available.  
✅ Import specific items (`ProductCategory`) in a cleaner way.  

Think of `self` as referring to "this module," just like it refers to "this instance" in methods.  

---

### Summary:  
- `use` can bring an entire module into scope.  
- `{self, ItemName}` syntax lets us import both a module and specific items.  
- This keeps code clean and avoids unnecessary repetition.
