# Documentation Comments:


1. **Regular Comments**: A regular comment begins with `//`, and the compiler ignores everything after that. 

2. **Documentation Comments**: These start with `///` and are used to generate documentation for functions, structs, enums, and more. Rust's compiler can automatically generate a webpage with this documentation.

3. **Placing Documentation Comments**: Place these comments directly above the entity you want to document (e.g., functions, structs, modules). This makes it clear what each component does for future developers or users.

4. **Example of Documentation**:
   - For functions: `/// Primary entrypoint into our warehouse program`
   - For modules: `/// Tools for inventory management`
   - For enums or structs: `/// A category of product that our business sells`
   
5. **Generating Documentation**:
   - Use `cargo doc` in the terminal to generate the documentation for your project.
   - You can also add the `--no-deps` flag to exclude dependencies and `--open` to automatically open the generated docs in a browser.
   - The generated docs can be opened as HTML files, and they will be well-organized, similar to the style of official Rust documentation.

6. **What Documentation Provides**: 
   - The generated documentation will include all the comments you added, providing clarity on what each part of the code does. It can be especially helpful for reusable code in libraries.
