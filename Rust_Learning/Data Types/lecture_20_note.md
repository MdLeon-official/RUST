# The dbg! Macro


- **dbg! Macro**:  
  - The **dbg!** macro is specifically designed for developers to debug and inspect values during development. 
  - It prints and returns the value of a given expression along with additional helpful details, such as the file name, line number, and the exact code that was executed.
  - It uses the **Debug** trait's `format` method to output the technical string representation of the data.
  - Unlike `println!`, which is mainly for user-facing output, **dbg!** is for developer debugging.

### How dbg! Works:
- **File and Line Information**:  
  The macro prints the file name, line number, and the exact code expression.
- **Result of the Expression**:  
  It shows the result of the expression as well, making it clear what value the code produced.

### Example:

```rust
let result = 2 + 2;
dbg!(result);
```

Output:
```
[src/main.rs:9] result = 4
```

Here, we get:
1. The file name (`src/main.rs`).
2. The line number where `dbg!` was used (`9`).
3. The exact code (`result = 2 + 2`).
4. The resulting value (`4`).

### Benefits of dbg!:
- It automatically shows more context (file, line, code, result) than `println!`.
- It avoids the need for explicit formatting like `{:?}` or `{:#?}`.
- It's shorter to write compared to `println!`.

### Usage:
- **Development Tool**:  
  The `dbg!` macro is intended for use during development to inspect values. It's **not** meant for production code and is generally removed after debugging.

### Key Takeaways:
- **dbg!** is a debugging tool that provides a quick way to print and inspect values along with context (file, line, code, result).
- Itâ€™s especially useful during development but should be removed once debugging is complete.
