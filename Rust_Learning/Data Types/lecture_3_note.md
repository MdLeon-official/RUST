# The usize and isize type

Rust provides different integer types based on the required memory size and whether the number is signed (can be negative) or unsigned (only positive values). The available types include:

- **Signed integers**: `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`
- **Unsigned integers**: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`
- **Platform-dependent types**: `isize`, `usize` (depends on system architecture: 32-bit or 64-bit)

## Code Examples

```rust
// Declaring an 8-bit signed integer
let eight_bit: i8 = -112;

// Declaring an 8-bit unsigned integer
let eight_bit_unsigned: u8 = 255; // Valid range: 0 to 255

// Declaring a 16-bit signed integer
let sixteen_bit_signed: i16 = -32_500; // Valid range: -32,768 to 32,767

// Declaring a 16-bit unsigned integer
let sixteen_bit_unsigned: u16 = 64_000; // Valid range: 0 to 65,535

// Declaring a 32-bit signed integer
let thirty_two_bit_signed: i32 = -2_147_483_648; // Default integer type in Rust

// Declaring a 32-bit unsigned integer
let thirty_two_bit_unsigned: u32 = 4_294_967_295; // Valid range: 0 to 4,294,967,295

// Alternate syntax: Type annotation after the value
let some_value = 20i8;  // Equivalent to let some_value: i8 = 20;
let another_value = 50u16;  // Equivalent to let another_value: u16 = 50;

// Declaring platform-dependent integer types
let days: usize = 55; // Equivalent to u32 on a 32-bit system, u64 on a 64-bit system
let temperature: isize = -15_000; // Equivalent to i32 on a 32-bit system, i64 on a 64-bit system

// Using underscores for readability in large numbers
let large_number: u64 = 1_000_000_000; // Equivalent to 1000000000
let binary_number: u8 = 0b1010_1010; // Binary representation for better clarity
```

## Explanation

1. **Fixed-size integers**: `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, etc., have a fixed memory allocation regardless of the system architecture.
2. **Platform-dependent integers**:
   - `usize` is equivalent to `u32` on a 32-bit system and `u64` on a 64-bit system.
   - `isize` is equivalent to `i32` on a 32-bit system and `i64` on a 64-bit system.
3. **Underscores for readability**: Rust allows underscores in numeric literals to make them easier to read (e.g., `1_000_000` is the same as `1000000`).
