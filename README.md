# 🦀 RUST

![Learning Rust](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/042/806/685/original/terrified-of-ice-cream-ferrisrust-frame.gif?1635480129)

Welcome to my Rust repository! This is a collection of Rust programs, practice problems, and mini projects that I’m working on as I learn the language.

## 🚀 About

This repo includes:

- 🧪 Practice problems from platforms like [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com).
- 📚 Notes and code snippets as I explore Rust's syntax and core concepts
- 💡 Concepts like ownership, borrowing, pattern matching, error handling, modules, etc.
- ⚙️ Small utilities and scripts (e.g., converters, algorithms, CLI tools) 

The goal is to build a strong foundation in Rust while writing clean and idiomatic code.

## 📚 Course

I'm currently learning Rust through the [Learn to Code with Rust](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-code-with-rust/) course on Udemy. This repo reflects what I’m learning and building along the way.

## 🔐 Future Goals

As I grow more comfortable with Rust, I plan to build **cybersecurity-related projects and tools**—leveraging Rust's speed and safety for secure coding, penetration testing tools, and CTF utilities.
